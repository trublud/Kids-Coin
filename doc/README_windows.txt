KidsCoin Core
=============

Intro
-----
KidsCoin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that is
completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or trusted
parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly
with each other, with the help of a P2P network to check for double-spending.


Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run kidscoin-qt.exe.
https://dl.bintray.com/boostorg/release/1.64.0/binaries/boost_1_64_0-msvc-14.1-64.exe
KidsCoin Core is the original KidsCoin client and it builds the backbone of the network.
However, it downloads and stores the entire history of KidsCoin transactions;
depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization
process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.
